## 🧠 About Me

I'm a motivated career-changer with a background in economics and business management, now focused on embedded systems development using C/C++. Over the past year, I completed a specialized training program and gained hands-on experience through an internship at Critical Software, working with STM32 microcontrollers and TouchGFX.

I'm passionate about building practical solutions and continuously expanding my skill set. Currently seeking entry-level opportunities in embedded systems or related fields, I’m also exploring data analysis, Python, SQL, machine learning, and AI. Open to remote or on-site roles in Coimbra or Aveiro, I bring adaptability, curiosity, and a strong commitment to learning.
